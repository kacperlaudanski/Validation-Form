# Validation-Form

A simple validation form is provided to create an account using an email and password. The form checks
the correctness of the entered data and returns possible errors. After the account is created, the user 
can log in using the provided data. The system utilizes Firebase services for authentication,
which ensures robust security and reliability. In addition to the account creation form, the system
also includes a login form for existing users to access their accounts. The project is built with a focus 
on simplicity, ease-of-use, and scalability to accommodate potential future features and expansions.
